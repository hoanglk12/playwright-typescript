# Instructions to push to GitHub

## 1. Create a new repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Enter a repository name (e.g., "playwright-testing-framework")
3. Add a description (optional): "Playwright TypeScript automated testing framework for UI and API testing"
4. Choose public or private visibility based on your preference
5. Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (as we already have these files)
6. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect your local repository to GitHub
Once your repository is created, copy the repository URL from GitHub and run these commands:

```bash
# For HTTPS (requires GitHub credentials each time)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# OR for SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Set the main branch and push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace:
- YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
- YOUR_REPO_NAME with the name you gave your repository

## 3. Verify
After pushing, visit your GitHub repository URL to confirm all files were pushed successfully. The GitHub Actions workflows in the .github/workflows directory will be automatically detected and available to run.
